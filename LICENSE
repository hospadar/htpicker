== Icons ==

Thanks to Danny Allen and "Exdaix" for the G-Flat SVG icon set.

These icons were obtained from <http://art.gnome.org/themes/icon/1281>.

The license there is stated as CC-BY (Creative Commons Attribution).

One of the icons (gsnes9x-icon.svg) has metadata stating that it is licensed
under the LGPL.  I have created a derivative icon (emulator-game.svg) which
would accordingly also be licensed under the LGPL.

== Code ==

browser.py was derived from demos/browser.py from pywebkitgtk SVN r161 on
Google Code, which was copyrighted by Jan Michael Alonzo and licensed under
GPL.  However, only a handful of lines remain of the original.  These six or so
lines of code are not creative in nature, are not used for profit, are a
trivial portion of the original work, and are not a substitute or competition
for the original work.  Thus, I believe that this is a reasonably clear-cut
instance of fair use, and that the original license does not apply.
Furthermore, I disclaim my own copyright to the file and dedicate it to the
public domain.

app.html is my own original work, and I disclaim copyright to it and dedicate
it to the public domain.
