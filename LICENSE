== Icons ==

Folder and Video icons are from the Nuvola icon pack (downloaded via
<http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnome-themes-extras/0.9/
gnome-themes-extras-0.9.0.tar.gz>) and are licensed under the LGPL.

The gamepad icon is from http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gamepad.svg,
which is a derivation of a Nuvola icon, and also licensed under the LGPL.

== Code ==

The 'htpicker' file was originally derived from demos/browser.py from pywebkitgtk SVN
r161 on Google Code, which was copyrighted by Jan Michael Alonzo and licensed
under the GPL.  However, at this point, no original code remains other than a
couple trivial lines that would inevitably be written exactly the same way
by any programmer.

I disclaim copyright to the 'htpicker' and 'app.html' files and dedicate them
to the public domain.
