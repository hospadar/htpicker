# How this config file works:
#
# Each section describes an external program used to play certain files, and
# then lists which files should be played by that program.  Each section has up
# to four lines.  Here is an example, followed by an explanation of each line.
#
# (Line 1) [mplayer]
# (Line 2) command = mplayer -fs {file}
# (Line 3) matches = ~/Videos/*, ~/Video/*, *.avi, *.mkv, *.mpg, *.mp4, *.flv
# (Line 4) icon = video
#
# Line 1 contains the section name.  This is solely for your own reference.
# The special section name 'options' is reserved.
#
# Line 2 contains a command to play files with.  The special term '{file}'
# indicates where the filename should go when executing the command.  Do not
# put quotes around it -- the proper quoting and escaping will be done
# automatically.
#
# Line 3 lists filename patterns, comma-delimited, that this command can play.
# These can also be used to specify entire folders to apply this command to, by
# doing /path/to/folder/*.  Note that these filename patterns use glob-style
# matching, not regular expressions.  So the familiar old wildcards of * and ?
# are what you want to use.  For gritty details on what other special
# characters may go into filename match patterns, run the command 'pydoc
# fnmatch.fnmatch'.
#
# Line 4 states which icon to show for these files.  The only current options
# are 'video', 'game', and 'folder'; though htpicker automatically uses the
# folder icon for directories, so you probably won't have any use for it.
#
# A few reasonable defaults have been put here for you:

[mplayer]
# this -geometry option is highly recommended, otherwise you will often get a
# briefly visible "phantom" mplayer window, before mplayer goes full screen.
command = mplayer -geometry 1x1+4000+4000 -fs {file}
matches = ~/Videos/*, ~/Video/*, *.avi, *.mkv, *.mpg, *.mp4, *.flv, *.divx, *.xvid
icon = video

[zsnes]
command = zsnes {file}
matches = ~/ROMs/SNES/*, *.smc, *.fig, *.zip
icon = game

[fceu]
command = fceu -fs 1 {file}
matches = ~/ROMs/NES/*, *.nes, *.nes.gz
icon = game

# And here is the global options section.
[options]
ignore = .*, *~, *.bak, *.nfo, *.txt, *.url, *.sfv, *.part*.rar
